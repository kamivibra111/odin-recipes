# odin-recipes
It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired through Odin Project in HTML from section FOUNDATION. In this project, we are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time we've finished. But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build our HTML chops.
